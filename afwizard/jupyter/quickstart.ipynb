    "\n",
    "We use the [sample data set for the AFwizard](https://heidata.uni-heidelberg.de/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.11588/data/TJNQZG), which consists of all necessary input data and sample files of data produced and used during the workflow. It also contains a [detailed description and explanation of all steps](https://heidata.uni-heidelberg.de/file.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.11588/data/TJNQZG/DYFJVQ&version=2.0). This QuickStart introduces the minimal steps that are necessary to perform adaptive filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample data should be downloaded into one folder without further hierarchy, and the notebook should be invoked in this folder, which thus functions as the `working directory`. All commands shown below can be used as presented, except for the commands in step 3, where the paths to proprietary filtering software must be set in the respective system environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before testing the Quickstart, the [Prerequisites discussed in the Documentation](https://afwizard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#prerequisites) and the [Installation of the AFwizard as explained in the Documentation](https://afwizard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#installing-and-using) must be set up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since all data in this QuickStart are stored and new data during the workflow are created in the same directory, explanations in the following codeblocks do not use subdirectories or paths. However, using subdirectories for different kinds of data is useful in the course of intensive work with the AFwizard. Furthermore, a sub directory for the final output will be created automatically if no option is given (see below \"Step 5: Adaptive Filtering\")."
